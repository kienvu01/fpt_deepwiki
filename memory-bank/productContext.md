# Product Context: DeepWiki-Open

## Problem Statement
Software documentation is often:
- Outdated or non-existent
- Time-consuming to create and maintain
- Disconnected from the actual code
- Difficult to navigate and understand
- Lacking visual representations of architecture and relationships
- Unable to answer specific questions about implementation details

Developers spend significant time trying to understand codebases, especially when:
- Onboarding to new projects
- Working with open-source libraries
- Maintaining legacy code
- Collaborating across teams
- Exploring unfamiliar parts of large repositories

## Solution
DeepWiki-Open addresses these challenges by:
1. **Automating documentation generation** using AI to analyze code structure and relationships
2. **Creating visual diagrams** to represent architecture, data flow, and component interactions
3. **Organizing information** into an intuitive, navigable wiki structure
4. **Enabling intelligent queries** through RAG-powered chat functionality
5. **Supporting deep research** with multi-turn investigation capabilities
6. **Providing flexibility** through support for multiple model providers

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- Users should be able to generate a wiki with minimal input (just a repository URL)
- The interface should be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate
- Documentation should be well-organized and accessible

### Comprehensiveness
- Generated wikis should cover all significant aspects of the repository
- Documentation should include both high-level overviews and detailed explanations
- Visual diagrams should accurately represent code relationships and architecture

### Intelligence
- The Ask feature should provide relevant, accurate responses to queries
- DeepResearch should enable thorough investigation of complex topics
- The system should understand code context and relationships

### Flexibility
- Support for multiple repository sources (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)
- Compatibility with various model providers (Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- Multi-language support for generated content

### Performance
- Wiki generation should be reasonably fast, even for large repositories
- The interface should be responsive and smooth
- Caching should optimize repeated access to the same repository

## User Workflows

### Basic Wiki Generation
1. User enters a repository URL
2. User configures options (model provider, language, etc.)
3. System generates a comprehensive wiki
4. User navigates through the wiki to explore documentation

### Private Repository Access
1. User enters a private repository URL
2. User provides an access token
3. System securely accesses and processes the repository
4. User explores the generated wiki

### Ask Feature
1. User navigates to a repository wiki
2. User asks a specific question about the codebase
3. System retrieves relevant context from the repository
4. System generates a contextually accurate response
5. User can ask follow-up questions in a conversational manner

### DeepResearch
1. User enables DeepResearch mode
2. User asks a complex question about the codebase
3. System conducts a multi-turn investigation process
4. System presents findings in structured stages
5. User can navigate between research stages to explore the full analysis

## Value Proposition
DeepWiki-Open transforms how developers interact with codebases by:
- **Saving time** through automated documentation generation
- **Improving understanding** with visual representations and clear explanations
- **Enhancing accessibility** by making complex codebases more approachable
- **Facilitating learning** through intelligent Q&A capabilities
- **Supporting collaboration** by creating a shared knowledge base
- **Reducing onboarding time** for new team members

## Target Scenarios

### Open Source Exploration
A developer discovers an interesting open-source project but is overwhelmed by its complexity. Using DeepWiki-Open, they generate a comprehensive wiki that helps them understand the project's architecture, key components, and how everything fits together.

### Team Onboarding
A new developer joins a team and needs to understand an existing codebase quickly. The team has already generated a DeepWiki for their repository, allowing the new member to explore documentation, visualize architecture, and ask specific questions about implementation details.

### Legacy Code Maintenance
A developer is tasked with maintaining a legacy system with minimal documentation. By generating a DeepWiki, they gain insights into the system's structure, dependencies, and functionality, making maintenance tasks more manageable.

### Architecture Review
A technical lead needs to review a project's architecture. Using DeepWiki's visual diagrams and comprehensive documentation, they can quickly assess the system's design, identify potential issues, and make informed recommendations.

### Learning Tool
An educator wants to help students understand real-world codebases. By generating DeepWikis for various projects, they provide students with accessible, comprehensive documentation that facilitates learning and exploration.
