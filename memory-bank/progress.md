# Progress: DeepWiki-Open

## Current Status

DeepWiki-Open is a functional project that successfully generates interactive wikis for GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket repositories. The system is operational with the following capabilities:

- Repository cloning and analysis for GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket
- Support for private repositories with token authentication
- Embedding generation for code retrieval
- Documentation generation with multiple model providers
- Visual diagram creation
- Wiki organization and navigation
- RAG-powered Ask feature for repository queries
- DeepResearch for multi-turn investigations
- Multi-language support
- Docker deployment

The project is in active development, with ongoing improvements and feature additions.

- Repository size limitations based on available memory
- Processing time can be lengthy for complex repositories

### Model Integration
- API rate limits can affect generation speed
- Token limits constrain context window size
- Model quality varies across providers
- API costs can accumulate with heavy usage

### User Interface
- WebSocket connections may require reconnection in certain scenarios
- Diagram rendering can fail for complex relationships
- Long-running operations may timeout without feedback
- Limited mobile responsiveness in some views
- âœ… Fixed: Turbopack compatibility issue with Google Fonts (removed --turbopack flag)

### Deployment
- Environment setup can be complex for new users
- Docker image size is relatively large
- Memory requirements can be substantial for large repositories
